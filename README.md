# HoneyFestival
High school project initially focused on web design (HTML, CSS, minimal JS), now enhanced with added functionality like APIs, databases, interactivity and more, now as a graduation project. Built around a fictional festival Honey, this project showcases both design and backend integration, evolving from a static site to a dynamic web experience.
